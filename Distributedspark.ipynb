With real-time data streaming from multiple sources, RetailWorld needs to clean, transform, and aggregate this data to derive actionable insights such as total Sales and Revenue per Product, Total Sales and Revenue per Store, Sales and Revenue per Promotion Type and Stock Analysis per Product.\n","\n","This dataset is a modified  <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/retail-sales-data?select=sales.csv\">sales</a> dataset taken from th Kaggle website. This data is collected from a Turkish retail company, covering the period from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2019.\n","It currently consists of 1033435 records.\n","\n","\n","## Dataset Description\n","\n","\n","**product_id**: This attribute represents the unique identifier for each product in the dataset. Each product is assigned a specific ID (e.g., P0001).\n","\n","**store_id**: This attribute represents the unique identifier for each store where the product is sold. Each store is assigned a specific ID (e.g., S0002).\n","\n","**date**: This attribute represents the date of sales data. It indicates when the sales, revenue, stock, and other information were recorded for a particular product in a specific store.\n","\n","**sales**: This attribute represents the number of units of the product sold on a given date in a particular store. It indicates the quantity of the product that was purchased.\n","\n","**revenue**: This attribute represents the total revenue generated from the sales of the product on a given date in a specific store. It is calculated by multiplying the number of units sold (sales) by the price per unit (price).\n","\n","**stock**: This attribute represents the quantity of the product available in stock at the beginning of the day on the specified date in the given store.\n","\n","**price**: This attribute represents the price per unit of the product on a given date in a specific store. It indicates the amount charged to the customer for each unit of the product.\n","\n","**promo_type_1**: This attribute represents the type of promotion (if any) applied to the product. It indicates the first type of promotional activity associated with the product, such as discounts, special offers, or marketing campaigns.\n","\n","**promo_bin_1**: This attribute represents the specific promotional bin (if any) associated with the first type of promotion. It provides additional details about the nature or category of the promotion.\n","\n","**promo_type_2**: This attribute represents the type of secondary promotion (if any) applied to the product. It indicates another type of promotional activity associated with the product, similar to promo_type_1 but potentially different in nature or timing.\n","\n","These attributes collectively provide detailed information about the sales, revenue, pricing, and promotional activities associated with each product in various stores over time.\n","\n","\n","## Challenges\n","Traditional data processing tools are inadequate for handling the velocity and volume of incoming sales data, leading to delays in analysis and decision-making. These delays hinder RetailWorld's ability to respond swiftly to market demands and optimize inventory and sales strategies.\n","\n","## Solution: Apache Spark\n","To address these challenges, RetailWorld requires a scalable and efficient solution. Apache Spark, with its distributed computing architecture and robust processing capabilities, is the ideal solution for RetailWorld's data analytics needs. Spark's ability to parallelize data processing tasks across a cluster of nodes enables rapid aggregation and analysis of large datasets. Additionally, its fault-tolerant design ensures reliability and resilience against failures, making it a dependable choice for RetailWorld's critical data processing tasks.\n","\n","**To know more about the Distributed Architecture of Spark <a  href=\"https://cf-courses-data.static.labs.skills.network/BmowmNpC6oPodsERIBziYg/DistributedArchApacheSpark-v1.md.html\">Click here</a>**.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e2015560-91dc-468c-bdc5-3abf35cdfc75","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### 1.
